  <li><strong>655</strong> - On her 18th birthday, Nimea ventures forth after being gifted with the elven mace <em>Fyregeld</em>, gifted to her from the elven vaults by the village elders.</li>
  <li><strong>656</strong> - Nimea slays her first goblin warband, led by the chieftain Skrotsnik. His head is handed to City Guards, yet she refuses payment - "Justice is payment enough".</li>
  <li><strong>659</strong> - Bringing low the foul machinations of the Cult of the Damned with the aid of a human rogue by the name of Amellis, she spends the night in his company. When she wakes the following morning, her gold and valuables have been thieved by the very knave who had helped her the day before. Amellis is added to her list of foes.</li>
  <li><strong>660</strong> - Nimea tracks the goblin warlord Rotgut to his lair under the Willowsmoke Mountains. The path into the gloomy dark is long and treacherous...</li>
