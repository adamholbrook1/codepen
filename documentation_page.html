  <p>Here is an introduction to the races of the fantasy world, and an insight into their nature and traits befitting their character. This documentation will serve as a guide in which to decide which of these races you would most like to play for any fantasy role playing game.</p>
 <p>Many people select a race and character that matches their own temperament. Many angry people play as Orcs, mischievous people play as goblins, and many noble hearted people play as elves. This is great! But do not be limited by similarity. Many people enjoy playing characters that do not normally match their persona, and this can make for excellent storytelling. </p>

  <header class='header'>Fantasy Worlds and Races</header>
 <p>Roleplaying in a fantasy world leads to endless possibilities, not only in the characters you play but the worlds you play in. Many people play in worlds that are similar to the one you're reading from now, but others play across dystopian universes, cataclysmic plains, underwater paradises, ruined cities and haunted glades. Each location gives rise to different races and classes. Undead for example may find more solace in the graveyards from whence they rise, and Dwarves may be more comfortable in their halls and throngs under the mountain. </p>
 <p>This technical documentation page contains a variety of races and their traits, but don't be limited by these choices. The fantasy realms contain far more races and entities to roleplay. Explore and get involved!</p>

<section class='main-section' id='Humans'>
  <header class='header'>Humans</header>
  <p>Humans are an inquisitve, bold and flawed race. Capable of almost any challenge if put to the test, this race has an affinity for adventure, for language and for love. This race can fill the role of any class and speciality, though suffer from being a 'jack of all trades'. They are an ideal beginner race.</p>
 <p>Humans are of average strength and height, and have relatively short lifespans. They have affinity for learning languages, a bonus to their luck, and learn all skills slightly faster than other races.</p>
  <li>Language learning.</li>
  <li>Boost to luck.</li>
  <li>Skill speed learning.</li>

<section class='main-section' id='Elves'>
  <header class='header'>Elves</header>
  <p>Elves are an ancient race, and very few of them remain in the world, having suffered an immense cataclysmic event that saw the demise of countless of their kind. They are tall, nimble and live for many hundreds years. They share a hatred for all of dwarf kind after countless centuries of fueds and war. They are a proud race, but have inherited a severe arrogance from their abilities.</p>
 <p>Elves have a natural affinity for archery and stealth, as well as magic of the high arts such as Light, Heavens and Nature.</p>
  <li>Bonus to archery and accuracy.</li>
  <li>Naturally nimble, making excellent thieves.</li>
  <li>Affinity for the magical fields of Light, Heavens and Nature.</li>
  <pre>

<section class='main-section' id='Dwarfs'>
  <header class='header'>Dwarfs</header>
  <p>Dwarfs are short, stocky and stalwart individuals, iconic with their heavy armour, board axes and long beards. They are natural grumblers, taking offence at the slightest of actions. They live long lives under the mountains, wary of all other races that aren't taking refuge amongst their stone halls... none more so than the Elves.</p>
 <p>Dwarfs are not in the slightest part magically talented, but what they lack in the magical arts they make up for in the finest armour and weapons the world has ever seen. They are fine warriors and smiths, and a dwarfen shield line is nigh impenetrable.</p>
  <li>Bonus to strength and defence.</li>
  <li>Affinity as warriors.</li>
  <li>Unparalled crafters of metal, stone and gems.</li>
  <pre>
  <code>
dwarven_quote = "By the honour of my ancestors, we will rid these mountain of greenskins, or my axe and beard will be forfeit."
</code>
</pre>
</section>
  <section class='main-section' id='Gnomes'>
  <header class='header'>Gnomes</header>
  <p>Gnomes are inquisitve creatures, forever interested in the machinations of the world on all scales. They possess a natural affinity in engineering, and are frequently employed by kings and lords across the land to construct giant astrolobes, mechanical steeds, elaborate dungeons and much more. Due to their size, Gnomes also make excellent thieves and scouts, able to slip behind enemy lines or climb walls with ease. They are also talented scholars and magicians, able to bend arcana to their will.</p>
 <p>Gnomes are small of stature, and benefit from a bonus to their dexterity and agility. They live relatively short lives and physically age swiftly. Gnomes also gain bonuses to their abilities in engineering, history and the arcane. </p>
  <li>Nimble and swift.</li>
  <li>Talented in engineering.</li>
  <li>Astute students of lore and magic.</li>
  <pre>
  <code>
gnome_quote = "The discombobulator is playing up again! Pass me the omni-tool and gyro-wires so that I can stabilise the mana fluctuations!"
</code>
</pre>
</section>
  <section class='main-section' id='Orcs'>
  <header class='header'>Orcs</header>
  <p>Orcs are large, brutish creatures. Taller than men and elves and much wider, orcs possess an incredible strength and impressive resilience to physical harm. Their green skin is tough, and only the surest of blows will break through. Many orcs find employment in security, mercenary work or simply join the multitude of armies in the world. Very few races can stand before an orcish war-charge and not baulk at the sight.</p>
 <p>Orcs gain bonuses to their strength and vitality, and can shake off vast amounts of damage that would fell lesser races. They are also capable of carrying more equipment, and have a greater immunity to disease and other maladies.</p>
  <li>Naturally strong fighters.</li>
  <li>High defense and resilience.</li>
  <li>Easily cause fear in other races.</li>
 <pre>
  <code>
orc_quote = "They face our warband with an army of one hundred men, and there are 6 of us. It's almost a fair fight."
</code>
</pre>
</section>
  <section class='main-section' id='Goblins'>
  <header class='header'>Goblins</header>
  <p>Goblins very much resemble gnomes in their tenacity and inquisitiveness, but where gnomes are cautious and resourceful, goblins tend to lean towards the extravagent. They possess a natural ability for machinery that stems from an innate comprehension not taught by books, but simply by will. As such, goblins have given birth to the wildest and foulest mechanical bombs, robots and missiles in the land. They are naturally wicked and cruel, and have an unnatural desire for gold and loot. Many goblins also seek the paths of evil sorcerers and necromancers, becoming patrons of the dark arts.</p>
 <p>Goblins share the green skin pigment of the larger orcish cousins, yet none of their fury in battle. They make up for this with their mechanical genius and arcane affinity in the realms of Death, Fire and Demonology.</p>
  <pre>
  <code>
goblin_quote = "You say they've got no coin on them and they're just beggars? Loot them again! If you find a coin, kill them. If you don't, kill them anyway!"
</code>
</pre>
  <li>Cruel and wicked, with a propensity towards evil.</li>
  <li>Mechanically minded... for devilish gains.</li>
  <li>Natural necromancers and an affinity in the dark arts.</li>
</section>
  <section class='main-section' id='Undead'>
  <header class='header'>Undead</header>
  <p>Not all those who have been re-animated are mindless servants to a master. Many retain their autonomy, though are forever twisted by their rotting bodies and minds. Many undead live forever, and are shunned by communities of the living, yet their souls cling to their bodies, providing them with a resilience not hold by mortal kind. The passing from life to death frequently drives such creatures mad, and many wicked sorcerers make dark alliances to reduce life to death as they have become.</p>
 <p>The undead have the greatest resilience of all creatures, for life has passed from their bodies and they are animated by sheer strength of will and refusal to pass over. Whilst many remain in the world as friendly beings through teaching and passing of knowledge, many remain in active fighting service as the only thing they've ever known.</p>
  <li>High resilience to damage and an invulnerability to many maladies that would affect the living.</li>
  <li>Resolute and without fear, for they have already faced the greatest fear of all - death.</li>
  <li>Giften sorcerers and warriors alike, undead are capable individuals in all fields, yet inspire terror and fear to the living.</li>
